# M2DGRï¼š a Multi-modal and Multi-scenario Dataset for Ground Robots 

## Abstract:

Intelligent ground robots  have significant application prospects due to their capability to fulfill special missions in complex and dangerous environments.Localization and mapping are critical modules of robot navigation.Unfortunately, most of the existing datasets of ground robots have limited scenes and scarce types of sensors, which restricts the development of localization algorithms for ground robots in dynamic scenes, night, fog and other challenging environments.
Here we present M2DGR:a new large-scale dataset collected by a ground robot which contains a full sensor-suite include surrounding and sky-pointing RGB cameras,an infrared camera,an event camera,an inertial measurement unit(IMU),a LIDAR,a consumer grade Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS providing centimetre accurate global positioning.The dataset include ample trajectories in highly diverse scenes covering rooms, elevators, streets, parking lots and so on.
Based on M2DGR, we evaluate the performance of a few state-of-art of SLAM algorithms in diverse scenarios, and analyze the scenarios where ground robots are not robust to.For the benefit of the research community,we make the dataset and evaluation results public.
